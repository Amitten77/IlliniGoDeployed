# Introduction
## What is IlliniGo?
To motivate UIUC students to explore campus, Illini Go is designed to have students search for characters around different locations/events on campus.  
1. Users can collect characters by taking pictures through their Camera feature
2. Users can see a catalog of all the characters theyâ€™ve collected
3. Users can click on each character to show the picture they took, character stats, date/time
4. Users can visit specific locations at specific times on campus to find characters
5. Users can share their Illini Go Profile through Social Media
6. Users have a profile featuring their characters/stats
